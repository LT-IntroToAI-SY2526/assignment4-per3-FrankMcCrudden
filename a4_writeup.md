# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
At first it was understanding how to directly have the player making changes to the board. When first trying to do this myself I didn't see that it was already done at the bottom. What was the hardest thing that I fully tried was attempting to make the board, i didn't realise that all it took was just assigning a value to a list made up of astericks.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
How i might adda computer player is depending on what the player did during their turn, the computer player would respond randomly with a few set options, or whatever remained. For example if the player placed an X at point 2, the computer would randomly choose between spots 1, 4, and 5. Or whatever remained a valid option.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
The computer player would always be focused on cutting off the player as much as possible, so that way the computer wouldn't ry to win. It would just try to make the player not win.
